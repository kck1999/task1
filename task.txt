any 2 lms sites


I believe udemy will be the best LMS platforom fi considering to upload the videos and 
publish publicly because it provides userwise tracking of how much learning the user has 
done and it also suggests the next courses to upskill and its certification.

BUT 

If we consider having a private platform then moodle can be the best because it can link the student to 
the institutes page in moodle and alsi provides userwise tracking too and the design is elegant and user friendly
